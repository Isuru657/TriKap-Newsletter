# TriKap-Newsletter
The inspiration for this project comes from Tri-Kap, my local fraternity. Being one of the olders fraternities in the United States, it has a large number of alumni from different walks of life. Unfortunately, there is no solid framework to maintain communications with all of our brothers and I believe that this would be a great first step to helping centralize communications. 

The website is hosted on Heroku : https://afternoon-hamlet-37704.herokuapp.com/

Enjoy!
